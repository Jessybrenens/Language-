# Section 4: Communication Evolution (Transition)

4. Communication evolution follows developmental principles.

4.1 Transitional stages mark communication transformation.
4.1.1 Context-to-cognition pathways enable developmental progression.
4.1.2 Environmental adaptation mechanisms precede internal representation.
4.1.3 Scaffolded communication transitions facilitate developmental leaps.

4.2 Recursive patterns demonstrate system self-organization.
4.2.1 Micro-level interactions generate macro-level communication structures.
4.2.2 Feedback loops reinforce adaptive communication patterns.
4.2.3 Self-similar patterns appear across developmental timescales.

4.3 Emergent properties transcend component functions.
4.3.1 Integrated communication systems exceed the sum of discrete skills.
4.3.2 Novel capabilities emerge at developmental transition points.
4.3.3 Cross-domain integration creates qualitative communication shifts.
