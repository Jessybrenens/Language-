# Section 2: Communication Systems Interconnection (Transition)

2. Communication systems interconnect through transitional mechanisms.

2.1 Structural bridges link linguistic and contextual domains.
2.1.1 Semantic-contextual interfaces enable meaning adaptation across environments.
2.1.2 Syntactic flexibility accommodates contextual constraints.
2.1.3 Pragmatic bridges translate intention across situational boundaries.

2.2 Functional overlaps create system interdependence.
2.2.1 Emotional-linguistic integration enables affective communication.
2.2.2 Cognitive-contextual overlap facilitates situational adaptation.
2.2.3 Identity-expression connections maintain self-coherence across contexts.

2.3 Developmental trajectories traverse communication domains.
2.3.1 Cross-domain skill transfer accelerates communication development.
2.3.2 Integrated communication competence transcends domain-specific abilities.
2.3.3 Transitional mechanisms evolve through developmental progression.
