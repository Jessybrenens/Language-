# Research Notes: Adaptive Communication Mechanisms

## Stress Response Patterns
- Linguistic constriction: Vocabulary narrowing under pressure
- Repetitive structures: Increased pattern reliance during stress
- Processing delays: Response latency as cognitive load indicator
- Simplification strategies: Reduced complexity during high stress

## Social Buffer Deployment
- Face-saving techniques: Preserving social standing
- Humor utilization: Tension diffusion through levity
- Topic shifting: Strategic redirection from threatening content
- Politeness escalation: Formality increase as distance mechanism

## Cognitive Flexibility
- Perspective shifting: Ability to adopt alternative viewpoints
- Reframing capacity: Reconstructing meaning of events
- Integrative complexity: Holding contradictory ideas simultaneously
- Adaptive reasoning: Modifying thought patterns based on feedback

## Identity Navigation
- Role-switching markers: Linguistic indicators of identity shifts
- Consistency maintenance: Narrative coherence across contexts
- Value expression: Communication of core beliefs
- Boundary signaling: Delineation of acceptable interaction parameters
