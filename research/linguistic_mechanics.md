# Research Notes: Linguistic Mechanics

## Semantic Density
- Definition: Information concentration per linguistic unit
- Measurement: Ratio of content words to function words
- Indicators: Lexical diversity, specialized terminology usage
- Impact: Higher density requires greater cognitive processing

## Syntactical Complexity
- Structural patterns: Simple, compound, complex, compound-complex
- Subordination: Embedded clauses indicate hierarchical thinking
- Coordination: Parallel structures indicate associative thinking
- Sentence length: Correlates with cognitive processing capacity

## Pragmatic Processing
- Context sensitivity: Adaptation to situational demands
- Implicature recognition: Understanding unstated meaning
- Speech act comprehension: Identifying directive vs. informative intent
- Register shifting: Ability to modify language for different audiences

## Emotional Encoding
- Lexical choices: Emotional vocabulary breadth and precision
- Prosodic features: Tone, rhythm, and emphasis patterns
- Metaphorical expressions: Indirect emotional communication
- Intensifiers and qualifiers: Emotional magnitude indicators
